# React Pokedex APP
A React pokedex APP that is built on [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).  

Side tangent:  
You may see some [discouraged pattern](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks#dispatching-actions) used in the codebase, e.g. dispatching other action in a thunk function, dispatching the fulfilled action of a thunk. I realized those patterns are not recommended, but as I was working on performance(actually I do spend quite a lot of effort and time working on reducing unnecessary re-render), I found those patterns pretty useful.  
It'd be appreciated if you can spend some time going through my code and let me know what you think.
